# Summary

Gravitational waves (GWs) are generated by the mergers of dense, compact
objects like black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs). This provides an
opportunity to study the strong field, highly dynamical regime of
Einstein's theory of general relativity (GR) at higher curvature scales
than previous observations (1--6). It is possible that at such scales
modifications to GR may start manifest. However, in order to detect such
modifications, we need to understand what deviations could look like in
theories beyond GR, in particular in the merger section of the signal in
near equal mass binaries, which are key targets of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA
network of detectors (and their future 3G successors). Such predictions
necessitate the use of numerical relativity (NR), in which the
(modified) equations of GR are evolved from an initial configuration
several orbits before merger, through the merger period and the
subsequent "ringdown", during which the gravitational wave signal can be
extracted near the computational boundary.

Current waveforms are tested for consistency with GR by measuring
parameterised deviations to the merger, inspiral and ringdown phases
(7--11), and not by comparison to any particular theories. If we obtain
predictions for specific models, we can check whether such parameterised
deviations are well-motivated and consistent in alternative theories of
gravity (1,12--17), and the potential to extract model parameters from
data.

There are many ways to modify GR, one of the simplest being to couple an
additional scalar degree of freedom, which may (if certain conditions
are satisfied) result in so-called "hairy" stationary black hole
solutions; that is, black holes with a stable, non trivial configuration
of the scalar field around them (see (18) for a review). An example of
this is the class of Horndeski models (19). Cubic Horndeski theories
have been studied in (21) and an implementation of this is included in
GRFolres. Another more general example within the Horndeski models is
the four-derivative scalar-tensor theory (4∂ST), which is the most
general theory with up to fourth powers of the derivatives (but still
second order equations of motion). Despite their relative simplicity,
they have lacked well-posed (and thus numerically stable) formulations
until relatively recently.

An important breakthrough was made in 2020 by Kov\'acs and Reall, who
showed that Horndeski theories are indeed well-posed in a modified
version of the harmonic gauge (22,23) - a particular coordinate system
already used in NR. Subsequently, several specific theories within these
classes were probed in their highly dynamical and fully non-linear
regimes (24--27). The extension of the results of (22,23) to the
alternative "singularity avoiding" coordinates in (28--30) offers an
alternative gauge in which to probe questions of hyperbolicity, and may
offer stability advantages for certain cases such as unequal mass
ratios, as studied in (27). Numerical work on these theories is still in
the early stages of development and many technical details on their
numerical implementation need to be further investigated. Equally, many
scientific questions, concerning our accurate understanding of binary
black holes' phenomenology in alternative theories of gravity and their
implications for tests of GR, also remain unanswered.

The goal of GRFolres is to meet this need for further research, and to
provide a model code to help others develop and test their own
implementations. The code is based on the publicly available NR code
GRChombo (31,32), which itself uses the open source Chombo framework
(33) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs).

In the following sections we discuss the key features, motivations and
applications of the code.

# Key features

GRFolres inherits many of the features of GRChombo and Chombo. Here we
list the key features. - Stable gauge evolution - The code implements
the modified moving puncture gauge that ensures a well posed evolution
in the weak coupling regime, as proposed in (28). The precise form of
the gauge and its parameters can be changed and the standard moving
puncture gauge is safely recovered by setting certain parameters to
zero. - Modified gravity theories - The currently available theories in
the code are 4∂ST and cubic Horndeski. The code is templated over the
theory (in the same way that GRChombo is templated over a matter class)
so that it can easily be changed without major code modifications. The
code also provides an implementation of 4∂ST without backreaction onto
the metric (but including the possibility of using the new gauge), to
enable comparison with previous works in the perturbative limit. -
Accuracy - The fields are evolved with a 4th order Runge-Kutta time
integration and their derivatives calculated with the same finite
difference stencils used in GRChombo (4th and 6th order are currently
available). - Boundary Conditions - GRFolres inherits all the available
boundary conditions in GRChombo, namely, extrapolating, Sommerfeld
(radiative), reflective and periodic. - Initial Conditions - The current
examples use solutions that approximately or trivially solve the
modified energy and momentum constraints of the theory. An elliptic
solver for more general configurations is under development, using a
modified CTTK formalism (34,35). - Diagnostics - GRFolres has routines
for monitoring the constraint violation and calculating the energy
densities associated with the different scalar terms in the action, as
discussed in (28--30). Other diagnostics can be added as required. We
also extract data for the tensor and scalar gravitational waveforms. -
C++ class structure - Following the structure of GRChombo, the GRFolres
code is also written in C++ and uses object oriented programming (OOP)
and templating. - Parallelism - GRChombo uses hybrid OpenMP/MPI
parallelism with explicit vectorisation of the evolution equations via
intrinsics, and is AVX-512 compliant. - Adaptive Mesh Refinement - The
code inherits the flexible AMR grid structure of Chombo, which provides
Berger-Oliger style (36) AMR with block-structured Berger-Rigoutsos grid
generation (37). Depending on the problem, the user may specify the
refinement to be triggered by the additional degrees of freedom,
i.e. the scalar field, or those of the metric tensor.

# Statement of Need

As far as we are aware there is currently no other publicly available
code that implements the 4∂ST theory of modified gravity or the cubic
Horndeski theory in 3+1-dimensional numerical relativity.

There is at least one private code, based on the PAMR/AMRD and HAD
(38,39) infrastructure, that was used in the first works to successfully
implement the modified general harmonic gauge for 4∂ST (24--27). Since
this code uses a Generalised Harmonic Coordinates (GHC) formulation, it
necessitates excision of the interior of black holes, which can be
difficult to implement in practice. As a consequence, many groups in the
numerical relativity community have opted to use singularity avoiding
coordinates such as the BSSN (40--42), Z4C (43,44) or CCZ4 (45,46)
formulations in the puncture gauge (47,48), which do not require the
excision of the interior of black holes from the computational domain.
In GRFolres, we use the results of (28--30) to extend the well-posed
formulations of modified gravity to singularity avoiding coordinates.
This provides an alternative gauge to the modified GHC one used by other
groups. Not only does this provide a valuable comparison to their work,
but also eliminates the need for excision.

There are also a number of 3+1-dimensional codes that implement the
equations for the additional scalar degree of freedom in
Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet without backreaction onto the metric
tensor, including one implementation using GRChombo (49), which we have
integrated into GRFolres to enable comparison between the methods. In
particular, Canuda (https://bitbucket.org/canuda) (50) which uses the
Einstein Toolkit (http://einsteintoolkit.org/), with its related Cactus
(http://cactuscode.org) (51,52) and Kranc (http://kranccode.org) (53)
infrastructure, was used in (50,54--57). Another implementation is based
on the Spectral Einstein Code or SpEC
(http://www.black-holes.org/SpEC.html) (58), as used in (59). Whilst
order-reduced methods like those in (12,49,50,54--57,59--62) provide an
estimate of the scalar dynamics and associated energy losses, they may
miss information about the fully non-linear impact on the metric and
suffer from the accumulation of secular errors over long inspirals.

In spherical symmetry several codes have been developed that implement
Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (a subset of the 4∂ST theory that we
include as an example in GRFolres). In particular, using the NRPy
framework (http://astro.phys.wvu.edu/bhathome) (63) in (60), and the
private code of Ripley & Pretorius in (64--68). Spherical codes provide
a useful testing ground in which coordinate ambiguities can be avoided
(64), but lack the generality required to study objects with angular
momentum, or binary mergers.

# Research projects to date using GRFolres

So far the code has been used to study a range of fundamental physics
problems, as listed here. - The test field case was used in (49) to
model the scalar waves produced during the ringdown stage of binary
black hole coalescence in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet, and quantify the
extent to which current and future gravitational wave detectors could
observe the spectrum of scalar radiation emitted.
